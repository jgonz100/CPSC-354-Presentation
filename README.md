## Julia has basic data types
- int
- float
- char
- bool
- string
- As well as other types for precision computations, complex, irrational, and rational numbers an more!

## Julia is an emerging language in data science as it supports
- Handling tabular data (csv)
- Built in matrices
- Built in vectors
- Speed relative to C and C++

# Key Feature: Multiple Dispatch
- A method can be dynamically dispatched based on its run time, type, or arguments
- Most implemented in computational code to consider all argument types on an operator

# Parallelism
- Julia allows for parallelization out of the box using the '@' macro.
- To call a parallel function all you need to do is apply '@parallel' to your code.
- Julia allows allows for dynamic scheduling with the built in Channel feature.
- More information can be found in the Julia parallel computing documentation [Here] (https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/parallel-computing/)
