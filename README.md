- As well as other types for precision computations, complex, irrational, and rational numbers an more!

## Julia is an emerging language in data science as it supports
- Handling tabular data (csv)
- Built in matrices
- Built in vectors
- Speed relative to C and C++

# Key Feature: Multiple Dispatch
- A method can be dynamically dispatched based on its run time, type, or arguments
- Most implemented in computational code to consider all argument types on an operator
